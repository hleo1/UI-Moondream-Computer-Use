# NOTE:  These are high-level “skeleton” steps that follow the standard
#        PowerPoint workflow:
#            1)  F12  →  Save As dialog
#            2)  Pick “PNG” in the “Save as type” dropdown
#            3)  Save
#            4)  When prompted, choose “All Slides”

#        Co-ordinates are expressed as ratios (0–1) of the full screen.
#        You may fine-tune them once you know the exact monitor / window
#        layout.  The same logic works for one presentation at a time;
#        wrap it in a loop if you later want to process multiple files.

start
# --- make sure the PowerPoint window is active --------------------------------
move_to((0.50, 0.08))      # click somewhere in the ribbon area
left_click()

# --- open “Save As” ------------------------------------------------------------
hot_key('f12')             # F12  is the quickest way to open the Save-As box

# --- choose PNG as the output format ------------------------------------------
# click the “Save as type” dropdown (usually bottom-right of the dialog)
move_to((0.72, 0.88))
left_click()

# press “p” — the first PNG entry is usually selected immediately
type_text('p')
hot_key('enter')           # confirm the PNG choice

# --- save the file -------------------------------------------------------------
# click the Save button (bottom-right)
move_to((0.92, 0.88))
left_click()

# --- when PowerPoint asks “All slides / Just this one” -------------------------
move_to((0.58, 0.60))      # “All Slides” button is normally centred
left_click()

# the slides are now exported to  <presentation-name> Folder\Slide1.png, …
