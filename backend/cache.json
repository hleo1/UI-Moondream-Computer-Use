Could you show or describe the exact manual steps you normally take in PowerPoint to export the slides\u2019 images (e.g., \u201cFile \u2192 Save As \u2192 PNG\u201d, or \u201cSelect all slides \u2192 Right-click \u2192 Save as Picture\u201d)?  \n2. Are you using the desktop version of Microsoft PowerPoint, the web version, or another program (e.g., LibreOffice Impress)?  \n3. Where should the extracted images be placed? Always in a newly-created folder next to the PPTX file, or do you want to choose a target directory each time?  \n4. Do you want every slide exported (including hidden ones), or only the currently visible slides?  \n5. Should the automation name the image files in any particular way (e.g., slide number, slide title)?\nANSWERS:\n\nFollow my example to the best of your ability."
